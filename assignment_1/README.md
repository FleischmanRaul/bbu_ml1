In this assignment we will become familiar with the following python packages:

* Numpy: package for storing and manipulating N-dimensional arrays

* Matplotlib: package for visualizing data

## Download and install Anaconda
During the laboratory assignments we will use *Pyhton* and *Jupyter* notebooks. 

In order to make the configuration easier we will also use *Anaconda*. Anaconda is a Python distribution for data science and machine learning applications which also contains a virtualization and package management system, called *conda*. 

With the use of conda we will create an environment and install the necessary packages for this assignment: 
- Download and install Anaconda with Python 3.7 from https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/scsanad/bbu_ml1.git`
- Open the folder containing this repository
- Make sure you have the latest commit: `git pull`
- Open the *assignments_1* folder
- Create an environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml` 
- Activate the environment: 
    - Windows: `activate ML_intro`
    - Linux/macOS: `source activate ML_intro`


## Open the notebooks with Jupyter
- Start Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
- Open the notebooks from the web interface, complete the missing code segments and run the cells
